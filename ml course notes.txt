Lessons:

Try to convert whatever mathematical expression into matrices/vectors and its operations.
why: because matrix operations are efficient due to libraries like numpy.
In practice, especially for small training sets, when you plot learning curves to debug your algorithms, 

it is often helpful to average across multiple sets of randomly selected examples to determine the training error and cross validation error.

Concretely, to determine the training error and cross validation error for  𝑖  examples,
	you should first randomly select  𝑖  examples from the training set and  𝑖 examples from the cross validation set.
You will then learn the parameters  𝜃  using the randomly chosen training set
	and evaluate the parameters  𝜃  on the randomly chosen training set and cross validation set.
The above steps should then be repeated multiple times (say 50)
	and the averaged error should be used to determine the training error and cross validation error for  𝑖  examples.
	

Principal Component Analysis:
-----------------------------
PCA is a linear transformation that finds the "principal components", or directions of greatest variance, in a data set.
It can be used for dimension reduction among other things.

conect bio to math
input layer, one or more hidden layers (intermediate layers) and output layer
weights and biases
activation / sigmoid / logistic function

diagram and formula
explain notation in detail, especially theta (dimensions)


define z and a
let x = a(1)
sub in equation

add bias a0(j) = 1
inputs are matrices, vectors and scalars, but ultimate output will be a number h(x) only
intermediate layers vecchi we can produce more complex non-linear hypothesis

achieve the functionality of OR, NOT and XOR by using neural networks:

simple boolean operations => one intermediate layer is enough
we know that g(z) , i.e sigmoid function will be :

	g(z) -> 1 for z >= 4.6 and
	g(z) -> 0 for z <= -4.6

here, z takes the form: b + w1x1 + w2x2, also x1 and x2 are boolean values
so, choose b,w1,w2 such that z will be >= 4.6 (so g(z) = 1) or z will be <= -4.6 (so g(z) = 0)

example: 

for OR function, we have:
b = -10, w1 = +20, w2 = +20

so, if x1 and x2 = 0, we get g(z) = g(-10) = 0
otherwise, for other combinations, we get g(z) = 1
so OR gate function is achieved.

multiple layer example: 
lets implement xnor gate with more than 1 hidden layer:

xnor => either both are 0 , or both are 1.
=> or of both 0 case and both 1 case.


One effective strategy for choosing  𝜖𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡  is to base it on the number of units in the network.
A good choice of  𝜖𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡  is  𝜖𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡=6 / √𝐿𝑖𝑛+𝐿𝑜𝑢𝑡√  where  𝐿𝑖𝑛=𝑠𝑙 and  𝐿𝑜𝑢𝑡=𝑠𝑙+1  are the number of units in the layers adjacent to  Θ

Activation functions:|
_____________________|


logistic sigmoid function:
	advantage:
		continuous function, having output btwn 0-1
	disadvantage:
		The logistic sigmoid function can cause a neural network to get stuck at the training time.
		The gradients are between 0 and 1, so if your network is deep, the gradient at the end (loss function) 
			would be multiplied along the layers(chain rule) and when this reaches a farther layer from output,
			the gradients won't be high at all(multiplication of lot of numbers between 0 and 1)

tanh:
	tanh is also like logistic sigmoid but BETTER.
	The range of the tanh function is from (-1 to 1). tanh is also sigmoidal (s - shaped).

	Advantages:
		Both functions are differentiable and monotonic while its derivatives are not monotonic.
		Both tanh and logistic sigmoid activation functions are used in feed-forward NNs.
	Disadvantages:
		sigmoid function is a SLOW learner. Instead, use Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU).
		
ReLU:
	ReLU(a) = max(0,a), where a : activation
	Advantage:
		More accurately models the behaviour of real neurons.
		The function and its derivative both are monotonic.
	Disadvantage:
		All the negative values become zero immediately which decreases the ability of the model to fit or train from the data properly.
		That means any negative input given to the ReLU activation function turns the value into zero immediately in the graph,
			which in turns affects the resulting graph by not mapping the negative values appropriately.
		So we use Leaky ReLU instead.

Leaky ReLU:
	ReLU, but with very slight slope in the -x direction (leak duh!).
	i.e f(x) = ax, when x<0 (a ~ 0.01), f(x) = x when x>=0
	When a is not 0.01 then it is called Randomized ReLU.
	The function and its derivative both are monotonic.

SEE https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6 for more details.

Multiclass classification:

	The softmax function is a more generalized logistic activation function which is used for multiclass classification.
	but it is only suited for multiclass single label application, because the sum of probablilties of all classes are 1.
	whereas sigmoid is suited fro multiclass multi-label application., because for individual output class, its output can be btwn 0-1.
	what is multiclass multi-label ?
		in a simgle picture, more than one class is present (ex. more than 1 digit in a picture)

	To do so, we make the hypothesis function return a vector of values, instead of a single value.
	explain the transport example


Choosing an Activation Function:
--------------------------------
In a NN:
	the activation functions used in the intermediate layers are either ReLU or Leaky ReLU
	the activation function used in the last layer is either sigmoid / tanh / softmax, depending on the range and type of output that you want.

TLDR: “What neuron type should I use?”
	Use the ReLU non-linearity, be careful with your learning rates and possibly monitor the fraction of “dead” units in a network.
	If this concerns you, give Leaky ReLU or Maxout a try. Never use sigmoid. Try tanh, but expect it to work worse than ReLU/Maxout.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 0TX means (theta transpose) * X = theta1 x1 + theta2 x2 + ... thetan xn
			X -> vector ->  [
								x1
								x2
								...
								xn

SVM: Support Vector Machines:
------------------------------

svm -> another learning algo alternative to Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
	-> compared to above algos, this one is sometimes cleaner and sometimes more powerful way of learning complex non-linear functions.
	
mathematical definition:

we use the following hypothesis function:

	h0(x) =  1 if 0Tx >= 0
	h0(x) =  0 otherwise
	
instead of the  1 / ( 1 +  e^-0Tx ) function that we used in Logistic Regression.

Logistic Regression gives you probablilty, whereas SVM just predicts the outcome directly (like a 'yes' or 'no' question)

cost function:

	logistic regression has the following structure for J :
		
			A + LB  (L = Lambda)
				
	so that we control (regularize) the weights given to A and B by controlling L value.
	if L is big, then B will be given more weightage in cost function.
	
	
	In SVM: J takes the following format:
			
			CA + B
	
	so weightage is controlled by varying C.
	if we make C = 1/L , then the same value of 0 (theta) will give min value..
	
Geometrically speaking:

	If y = 1, ( i.e we want 0Tx >> 0  , or z >> 0  ): 
		
	the cost function curve will be like:
		
		cost = 3 when z = -3
		cost -> 0 when z >> 0 (i.e  z -> inf)
		
	svm's cost function curve will be like 2 straight lines:
	
		one straight line:
			cost ~ 3 @ z = -3 , until cost = 0 @ z = 1
		another straight line :
			cost = 0  from  z = 1 till inf
		
	If y = 0:
		
		svm: just take reflection of the above curve about y axis (cost axis)
	
	
	So, in conclusion:
	
		Logistic Regression:
			
				if y = 1, we want z = 0Tx >> 0
				if y = 0, we want z = 0Tx << 0
				
		SVM:
			
				if y = 1, we want z = 0Tx >= 1
				if y = 0, we want z = 0Tx <= -1
	
				
	SVM is sometimes called as a Large Margin Classifier.
	
	what is a Large Margin Classifier:
	
		A classifier that gives a good margin between the 2 classes of data.
		i.e the decision boundary leaves a gap between the 2 classes of data.
		
		This also solves 2 problems:
			1. outliers don't affect the decision boundary.
				this is possible provieded C is not too large.
			
			2. If the data is not Linearly Seperable (i.e cannot be seperated by a straght line), decision boundary is the same.
				if we have few opposite class data in one side, then it may not be linearly seperable.
				this is possible provieded C is not too large.
				
		If C is very large, then it does not have a large margin, on both sides.
		So we have to keep C at a medium large number.
		
Gaussian kernel:
----------------
To find non-linear decision boundaries with the SVM, we need to first implement a Gaussian kernel. 
You can think of the Gaussian kernel as a similarity function that measures the “distance” between a pair of examples, ( 𝑥(𝑖) ,  𝑥(𝑗) ).
The Gaussian kernel is also parameterized by a bandwidth parameter,  𝜎 , which determines how fast the similarity metric decreases (to 0)
as the examples are further apart.

Debugging guide:


	Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB).

	There is an important distinction between python arrays (called list or tuple) and numpy arrays. 
	You should use numpy arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with numpy arrays. 
	Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).

	If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions.
	Printing the dimensions of numpy arrays using the shape property will help you debug.

	By default, numpy interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the dot function in numpy.
	For, example if A and B are two numpy matrices, then the matrix operation AB is np.dot(A, B).

Matrices and Vectors:

	matrix: row and columns
	vector: only rows

	examples:
	y : The values of the function at each data point. This is a vector of shape (m, ).
	X : The input dataset of shape (m x n+1), where m is the number of examples,
			and n is the number of features. We assume a vector of one's already 
			appended to the features so we have n+1 columns.
			
	shape property gives the dimensions of the matrix.
		ex: X.shape -> [2,3]  and X.shape[0] = 2
	size property gives no.of elements of the vector.
	
	The following is still considered a matrix np.array([[1, 2, 3]]) 
	since it has two dimensions, even if it has a shape of 1x3 (which looks like a vector).
	
	A vector can be promoted to a matrix using y[None] or y[np.newaxis].
	That is, if y = np.array([1, 2, 3]) is a vector of size 3, then  y[None, :] is a matrix of shape  1x3.
	We can use y[:, None] to obtain a shape of  3x1 .

	dot() function:
	
		It always performs inner products on vectors. If x=np.array([1, 2, 3]), then np.dot(x, x) is a scalar.
		For matrix-vector multiplication, so if X is a mxn matrix and y is a vector of length m,
		then the operation np.dot(y, X) considers y as a 1xm vector.
		On the other hand, if y is a vector of length n, then the operation np.dot(X, y) considers y as a nx1 vector.

	np.dot() is the dot product of two matrices.

	|A B| . |E F| = |A*E+B*G A*F+B*H|
	|C D|   |G H|   |C*E+D*G C*F+D*H|

	Whereas np.multiply() does an element-wise multiplication of two matrices.

	|A B| ⊙ |E F| = |A*E B*F|
	|C D|   |G H|   |C*G D*H|
	
	
	Add a column of ones to X:
		stack() joins arrays along a given axis. 
		The first axis (axis=0) refers to rows (training examples) 
		The second axis (axis=1) refers to columns (features).
		ex: X = np.stack([np.ones(m), X], axis=1)


	@ operator : matrix multiplication operator
	
	np.all() : Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.
		ex: np.all(variable_a == variable_b)
		
	in a numpy array, Row => axis = 0  and column => axis = 1
	so, row_sum = np.sum(X, axis = 0) and column_sum = np.sum(X, axis  = 1)
	
	argmax(): you can use np.argmax(A, axis=1) to obtain the index of the max elem for each row.
	
	
scipy.optimize.minimize()
------------------------
							Automatically finds the best parameters theta, for a given cost function and fixed dataset (of X and y values). 
	ex:
	-----------------------------------------------------
	options= {'maxiter': 400}
	
	res = optimize.minimize(costFunction,
							initial_theta,
							(X, y, lambda_),
							jac=True,
							method='TNC',
							options=options)

	# the fun property of `OptimizeResult` object returns
	# the value of costFunction at optimized theta
	cost = res.fun

	# the optimized theta is in the x property
	theta = res.x
	-----------------------------------------------------
	Here:
		costFunction: name of your cost function
		jac: Indication if the cost function returns the Jacobian (gradient) along with cost value. (True)
		lambda_: regularization parameter
		method: Optimization method/algorithm to use
					here, it uses "TNC" :  truncated Newton algorithm, for optimization which is equivalent to MATLAB's fminunc
